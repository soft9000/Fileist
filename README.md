# Fileist
A place to share our never-ending list of file reporting &amp; management 'notions.

Inspiring the project name, fileist.py contains a class, as well as a **C**ommand-**L**ine **I**nterface (CLI.)

Together, the mission of Fileist is to create a list of newest (default,) or oldest (-o) fully-qualified file names. -Those names being found in the 'pwd,' (also default) or a directory tree (-f.) 

An optional file-suffix can be specified (-s), a truncated-display option (-x), as well as the overall list-size (-l) for the final, file-name, report.

Simple but effective design. A CLI whose use case we find extremely usefull for resuming, as well as pruning, our Dev, as well as our Ops, efforts.
