# Fileist
A place to share our never-ending list of file reporting &amp; management 'notions. 

Shared to include an A.I session to match the code we just checked-in as part of '[Gig Success education](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-4000-gig-success/?referralCode=91DD0373A4C99D8F1A20),' and also part of our [DevOps educational opportunity](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-4000-gnu-devops/?referralCode=E04F0744698A4BE930D7) as well. 

Pythoneers might also enjoy the new [Total Pythoneering](https://www.youtube.com/@TotalPythoneering) channel as well?

***File:*** __fileist.py__

Inspiring the project name, fileist.py contains a class, as well as a **C**ommand-**L**ine **I**nterface (CLI.)

Together, the mission of Fileist is to create a list of newest (default,) or oldest (-o) fully-qualified file names. -Those names being found in the 'pwd,' (also default) or a directory tree (-f.) 

An optional file-suffix can be specified (-s), a truncated-display option (-x), as well as the overall list-size (-l) for the final, file-name, report.

Simple but effective design. A CLI whose use case we find extremely usefull for resuming, as well as pruning, our Dev, as well as our Ops, efforts.

***File:*** __dirist.py__

Mission: Examine a folder hirearchy, gathering a finite list of small / large sub-trees that match a set commonly-required, reporting criteria. Includes a Command Line Interface (CLI.) Creates a pipe-delmited report (stdout), ready for further analysis / charting.

***File:*** __piranha-wipe.py__

Born out of our need to wipe-out a mountable partition / device _tan rapido como possible_, we used the phrase **piranha wipe** (no, it will not catch-on :) to describe using _several independant_ processes to bus-saturate such a content consuming process. -Just how many fish to loose on your unsuspecting drive, is left up to you.
